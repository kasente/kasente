				<h2 class="section-title">My Roots</h2><br>
				<h3 class="section-title">A  journey of Passion and Purpose</h3>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Tanzania, my homeland, born in a small village, nestled in the northwestern part of the country. 
						My parents, passionate farmers, instilled in me a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for the land. 
						Their dedication and love for their craft continue to inspire me to this day, fueling my determination to pursue my dreams despite any challenges that may come my along.
					</p> <br>

					<p>
						At the tender age of eight, I embarked on a new chapter in my life, moving to Nairobi, Kenya, where I lived with a portion of my extended family. 
						This significant transition marked the beginning of my personal journey, opening up a world of new opportunities for learning and personal growth.
						 Navigating this change at such a young age undoubtedly shaped my perspective on life, instilling in me a sense of resilience and adaptability that has proven invaluable throughout my formative years.

				<h2 class="section-title">Personal Growth</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p> 
				      Upon graduating from high school in Kenya, I found myself at a crossroads, facing the daunting task of charting my future path. 
						While I possessed a natural inclination towards the social sector, my aspirations remained somewhat undefined.
						 Seeking to gain practical experience and broaden my horizons, I delved into the world of work. My initial foray involved volunteering with the Red Cross,
						  gaining valuable insights into the realm of public health. Simultaneously, I nurtured a growing interest in French culture, a fascination that would ultimately shape the course of my future endeavors.
				   </p>
				   <br>
                    <p>
					    After a year of immersive experiences and dedicated volunteer work,
					  my passion for French culture had blossomed into a burning desire to fully immerse myself in its rich tapestry.
					  At the age of 22, I embarked on a daring adventure, fulfilling a long-held dream of venturing to a new continent â€“ France. This ambitious endeavor, however, came with a significant financial hurdle. 
					  With  determination, I set out to accumulate the necessary funds, taking on various odd jobs, including work in the restaurant industry and providing tutoring and academic support to high school students.
					   Through sheer hard work, unwavering perseverance, and the support of my family, I finally achieved my goal, landing in the vibrant city of Paris.

				<h2 class="section-title">The evolution of my journey</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Paris became a turning point in my life.
					 The vibrant city streets served as my classroom, instilling valuable lessons in independence and self-reliance. While pursuing the Diploma of French as a Foreign Language,
					  I experienced significant personal and academic growth. This journey was further enriched by teaching English to both children and adults, fostering cultural exchange and strengthening
					   my communication skills through the challenges and rewards of language instruction.</p>
					<br>
					<p>
                       Embracing new experiences became a constant theme. My initial path led me to a Bachelor's program in Education. However, after two years, I embarked on a self-discovery journey that led me to healthcare. 
					   As an Educational and Social Support Worker, I supported individuals facing challenges. This role honed my interpersonal skills and instilled a deep understanding of compassion in healthcare. While a detour from my initial plan,
					    this experience reaffirmed 
					   my commitment to making a positive impact on the well-being of others. It became a pivotal moment, propelling me towards exploring new avenues for personal and professional development.

				<h2 class="section-title"> And now, how did I get into web development?</h2>
				<div class="content">
				<p>In navigating the challenges posed by website accessibility, I discovered a passion for bridging gaps and fostering autonomy in those I assisted.
					Despite facing hurdles due to varying levels of literacy, I remained determined to empower individuals to navigate the online world confidently.
				    Additionally, my desire to streamline cross-cultural experiences sparked ideas on simplifying travel planning and booking processes for seamless journeys. 
					I would love to contribute to projects that  create tech-driven solutions that enhance accessibility and foster independence.
