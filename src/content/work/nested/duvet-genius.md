 <strong>User-Centered Design for a Seamless Shopping Experience</strong>

Our team prioritized user-friendliness throughout the development of this platform. We envisioned an intuitive interface that empowers customers to effortlessly browse and purchase the products they desire.<br> By adopting a user experience (UX) centric approach, we ensured a smooth and enjoyable navigation experience, guiding customers through their shopping journey seamlessly.

The <strong> agile</strong> methodology fostered a collaborative environment, allowing each team member to contribute to both the front-end and back-end development.

<strong>My Contributions:</strong><br>
On the back-end, I played a key role in developing the database structure and API routes. These routes empower administrators to effortlessly manage product information, enabling them to add or update product details within the database.

For the front-end, I leveraged my expertise in CSS to craft the platform's visual style, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
