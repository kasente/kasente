I'm pouring my heart and soul into a personal project: a mobile safari booking app built with React. <br> This app aims to revolutionize the way people plan their dream adventures. <br> I've meticulously planned the app's architecture for a seamless user experience, and embraced containerization technology to ensure it can effortlessly scale as the user base grows.<br> My primary focus is on creating a user-friendly and engaging platform, one that goes beyond simply booking a trip and offers a truly enriching experience.

To bring this vision to life, I'm leveraging a robust tech stack. The user interface will be built with React, providing a modern and interactive experience.<br> The backend is powered by Laravel, ensuring smooth data management and communication. <br> Postgres serves as the reliable database, while Docker ensures scalability.  For version control and collaboration, I rely on Git and GitHub. Finally, Google Docs aids in project management, making sure everything stays organized.<br>
