<strong>Project:<br> 
Connected-User</strong>

In collaboration with the team, I joined an existing PHP project. The goal was to continue working on the existing project and make the site usable so that users could create-Account, LogIn, read, post, like, and add comments to their wall.<br> My primary responsibility was to refactor code in various files, ensuring better quality and simplified maintenance.

<strong>Key Contributions:</strong>

Refactored code: <br> Improved code quality and maintainability by restructuring and simplifying code in various files.<br>
Implemented <strong>like</strong> functionality: Added a function that allows users to like a post and have it counted in the database.<br>
Optimized site performance: Collaborated with the team to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks, improving the site's loading speed and responsiveness.
Impact:

Improved code quality:<br> The refactored code is now easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
Increased site performance: The site now loads faster and responds more quickly to user actions.<br>
